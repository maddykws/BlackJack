# BlackJack
This is a small BlackJack game in JavaScript in the hopes that you out there reading this can use it as a frame to build something much bigger. And if you're a beginner in the programming world, than perhaps this tutorial will help you get a much better idea of how function, objects and DOM manipulation works in JS.

While the following post won't be using any incredibly advanced topics in JavaScript, it is rather involved in what needs to go into a Blackjack game. I recommend the following book Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. \


Seperating the UI
In order to understand the code, I will be splittling the code into 2 parts. 
Number 1: UI section 
Number 2: JavaScript section. 

Code: 
Building the deck: 
The first thing we make in our game is developing a deck. Here essentially where are making a deck array of 52 cards
You can find this in deck.js file. 
A quick shuffle algorithm has been developed to understand the picture more better. 

Building Players: 
Take an example of 2 players. 
Steps to play the game: 
Step 1: Open the index.html file 
Step 2: Choose the number of players. 
Step 3: Press Start game and you will find the place for initial bets. 
Step 4: You can see the current bet is the multiples of 10
Step 5: There you go you can hit, stay and play the game.
