Seperating the UI
In order to understand the code, I will be splittling the code into 2 parts. 
Number 1: UI section 
Number 2: JavaScript section. 

Code: 
Building the deck: 
The first thing we make in our game is developing a deck. Here essentially where are making a deck array of 52 cards
You can find this in deck.js file. 
A quick shuffle algorithm has been developed to understand the picture more better. 

Building Players: 
Take an example of 2 players. 
Steps to play the game: 
Step 1: Open the index.html file 
Step 2: Choose the number of players. 
Step 3: Press Start game and you will find the place for initial bets. 
Step 4: You can see the current bet is the multiples of 10
Step 5: There you go you can hit, stay and play the game.
