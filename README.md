# BlackJack
This is a simple implementation of Blackjack that will run in a command-line/UI(see the link). The program begin by asking how many players at the table, start each player with $200, and allow players to make any bet in multiples of $10.

The program is implemented with following basic Blackjack rules, including: 
- Players can choose to hit until they go over 21 
- Dealer must hit on 16 and stay on 17 
- Players can or double-down or split (when applicable)
